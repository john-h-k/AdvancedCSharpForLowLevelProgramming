\chapter{Marshaling between C\# and C Part 2}
\section{String Marshaling}
For this part, we'll need to create a dotnet core console project for Chapter 6 and make sure to reference ''AdvancedDLSupport'' on nuget. You will need to add a build task for this project to compile C code after building C\# code. Your CSProj file should have the following:
\lstinputlisting[style=customxml, language=XML]{codes/Chap6/Chap6Snippet1.xml}

And for this lesson, we will have a few functions to play with for string manipulation from C Library:

\lstinputlisting[style=customc, language=C]{codes/Chap6/Chap6Snippet2.c}
